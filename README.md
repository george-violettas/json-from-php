Very easy to understand implementation of JSON objects in Android. The application is expecting to find a php page exporting a JSONArray. As soon as the appication reads a JSONArray from the provided URL, it will print at Log.v all the lines of the JSONArray line by line. The user now can easily use those lines/records for further usage, for example to import them in an Android Array.
